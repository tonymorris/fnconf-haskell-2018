# Two days of Haskell at FunctionalConf

### Bangalore, India, 13-16 December 2018

###### Introduction to Haskell syntax and tools, **Tony Morris & Alois Cochard, 120 minutes**

In this workshop, an attendee can expect to go from zero knowledge about Functional Programming in Haskell to familiarity with almost all of the syntax of the Haskell programming language, and associated tools. The general workflow of working with Haskell will be demonstrated in preparation for the subsequent workshops for the remainder of the day.

We will define Functional Programming to set the structure for the remainder of the day. We will explore most of the Haskell syntactic constructs and create your own reference material.

Participants will require a laptop with [GHC](http://haskell.org/ghc) and their favourite text editor installed.

We will explore the tooling that is provided with GHC to provide a basic workflow, so that the participant can later independently work with and explore other ideas with Haskell.

###### Starting Data61 Functional Programming Course, **Brian McKenna, 150 minutes**

Following Tony's introduction to functional programming and Haskell, we will work through the first few modules of Data61's Functional Programming Course. These modules cover writing functions for the optional and list data types.

We will complete enough exercises to cover basic data types, functions and polymorphism. We'll practice the techniques of equational reasoning, parametricity and type/hole driven development. After completing these modules, you should be able to use the techniques to attempt most other exercises in the repository.

This workshop has the same requirements as Tony's introduction, along with a download of a recent version of the fp-course repository (https://github.com/data61/fp-course).
