# One day of Haskell at FunctionalConf

### Bangalore, India, 13-16 December 2018

###### Introduction to Haskell syntax and tools, **Tony Morris, 75 minutes**

In this workshop, an attendee can expect to go from zero knowledge about Functional Programming in Haskell to familiarity with almost all of the syntax of the Haskell programming language, and associated tools. The general workflow of working with Haskell will be demonstrated in preparation for the subsequent workshops for the remainder of the day.

We will define Functional Programming to set the structure for the remainder of the day. We will explore most of the Haskell syntactic constructs and create your own reference material.

Participants will require a laptop with [GHC](http://haskell.org/ghc) and their favourite text editor installed.

We will explore the tooling that is provided with GHC to provide a basic workflow, so that the participant can later independently work with and explore other ideas with Haskell.
